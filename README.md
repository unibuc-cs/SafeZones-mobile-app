# SafeZones Product Vision
Empower individuals and communities to stay informed and safe by enabling real-time reporting and sharing of potentially hazardous events through an intuitive, map-based mobile application. This tool is designed for local residents and tourists alike, providing them with a reliable platform to identify, share, and discuss safety-related incidents. By using location-based alerts, categorized event markers, and a community-driven feedback system, users can proactively navigate urban environments with greater awareness and security.

# Product Features
1. **Incident Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly within the chat system of a pinpoint on the map.
2. **Contact Support**: Allow users to reach out for assistance directly through the app.
3. **Notification System**: Enhance user engagement and responsiveness by providing timely, relevant, and actionable push alerts.
4. **Trusted Contacts**: To enhance user safety and community support, the Trusted Contacts feature in the SafeZones app empowers users to build a reliable network of individuals who can assist them in times of need.

# Scenarios
1. Given the user is logged into the SafeZones app and has opened a chat within a specific incident pinpoint, when the user types a message and clicks "Send," then the message appears instantly in the chat for all users without refreshing the page.

2. Given the user is on the "Contact Support" page having a technical issue, feedback, feature request, safety concern, or anything, when the user types their inquiry and clicks "Submit," then the message is sent to the support team as an email, and the user sees a confirmation message. And if there’s an error, then the user receives an error notification.

3. Given the user is in the SafeZones app, when it gets close enough to an incident, then the user receives a real-time push notification alerting them of the potential danger.

4. Given the user is using the SafeZones app, then they can add other users as 'Trusted' by searching for them by username. If the user has added trusted contacts, when they feel unsafe, then they can send an emergency alert to their trusted contacts, including their current location, and grant location access to all trusted contacts.
